/**
 * The ＋ menu's mode rows and the divider above them.
 *
 * Each row gets the control its field is. Plan is a Session field of its own
 * and an independent switch. Swarm and Graph are the two values of one other
 * field, so they are one group and picking one is picking away from the other
 * — announced as a set rather than left for a screen reader to miss. Neither
 * is chosen at rest, and no row stands for that; every prop that feeds them is
 * optional, so a host can wire the modes alone, and then there is nothing
 * above the divider to divide.
